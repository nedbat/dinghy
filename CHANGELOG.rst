.. _changelog-1.3.2:

1.3.2 — 2023-09-21
------------------

Fixed
.....

.. _issue 36: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/36
.. _pull 37: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/37


.. _changelog-1.3.1:

1.3.1 — 2023-09-17
------------------

Fixed
.....

- When using a URL on the command line, the ``--since`` option was ignored.

.. _issue 35: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/35


.. _changelog-1.3.0:

1.3.0 — 2023-07-31
------------------

Added
.....

  closing `issue 26`_.

.. _issue 26: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/26


.. _changelog-1.2.0:

1.2.0 — 2023-01-27
------------------

Added
.....

- Now you can additionally specify digests on the command line to write, which
  will choose just those digests from the configuration file.

Fixed
.....

- If the config file has no ``digests:`` clause, it could be because it's not a
  dinghy config file at all, so print an error message about it.

.. _changelog-1.1.0:

1.1.0 — 2023-01-25
------------------

Added
.....

- A digest can specify ``template``, a Jinja2 template file to produce the
  digest.  This opens the possibility for other output formats than HTML.

.. _changelog-1.0.0:

1.0.0 — 2022-12-03
------------------

- Nothing has changed, just decided Dinghy was stable enough to call 1.0.0.

.. _changelog-0.15.0:

0.15.0 — 2022-11-09
-------------------

Added
.....

- Show releases in the digest. Thanks, Simon de Vlieger.

- A new setting ``include_bots: true`` will include pull requests, issues, or
  comments created by bot users.  The default remains False, to exclude them.
  Closes `issue 25`_.

.. _issue 25: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/25


.. _changelog-0.14.0:

0.14.0 — 2022-10-25
-------------------

Added
.....

- Now a CLI command is registered so you can use ``dinghy`` as a command
  instead of ``python -m dinghy`` (though that still works).

- You can now specify ``since: forever`` to include all activity regardless of
  when it happened.

Changed
.......

- Search results now always show the repo containing the item.

Fixed
.....

  (`issue 23`_).

.. _changelog-0.13.4:

0.13.4 — 2022-10-06
-------------------

Fixed
.....

- Comments on pull requests were only filtered by their age, not their authors,

  is now fixed.

0.13.3 — 2022-09-29
-------------------

Fixed
.....

- The hover tip for icons on pull requests and issues has text in the same

Changed

  needed to show the discussion threads of newer comments.  The old comments
  are shown in gray to help stay focused on recent activity.

  mistaken for "1 minute".  Fixes `issue 7`_

.. _issue 7: https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy/issues/7

Removed
.......

- Oops, it turns out there's no such thing as a repo project for "Projects
  (beta)".  That thing that wouldn't have worked has been removed.

- GitHub enterprise support: you can use URLs pointing to your own GitHub
  Enterprise installation.  Only a single host can be used.  Thanks, Henry

- Items in the configuration file can have ``title:`` to set an explicit title.
