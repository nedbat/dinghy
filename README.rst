Dinghy uses the GitHub GraphQL API to find recent activity on issues and pull
requests, and writes a compact HTML digest `like this <sample_>`_.


Getting Started
===============

1. Install dinghy:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install dinghy

2. To run dinghy you will need a GitHub `personal access token`_. The scopes you
   need to assign to it depend on what repos you'll be accessing:
   - If you are only accessing public repos, then you don't need any scopes.
   - If you will be accessing any private repos, then you need the "repo" scope.
   Create one and define the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable with the value:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_Y2oxDn9gHJ3W2NcQeyJsrMOez

.. _personal access token: https://github.com/settings/tokens

3. Then run dinghy with a GitHub URL:

   .. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m dinghy https://github.com/Me/MyProject
    Wrote digest: digest.html

   You will have a digest of the repo's last week of activity in digest.html.
   It will look `something like this <sample_>`_.

   You can also write a YAML configuration file to digest multiple sources, or
   with different time periods.


Configuration
=============

Dinghy configuration is read from a YAML file (``dinghy.yaml`` by default).
Here's an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    digests:
      - digest: lastweek.html
        title: My projects last week
        since: 1 week
        items:
          - https://github.com/orgs/myorg/projects/17
          - https://github.com/orgs/anotherorg/projects/8
          - https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/pulls

      - digest: hotnews.html
        title: Today's news
        since: 1 day
        items:
          - url: https://github.com/orgs/anotherorg/projects/8
            home_repo: anotherorg/wg
          - https://github.com/myorg/churnchurn/issues

      - digest: all_prs.html
        since: 1 day
        items:
          - search: org:myorg is:pr
            title: MyOrg pull requests

    defaults:
      ignore_users:
        - app-user
        - fake-bot

The ``digests`` clause is a list of digests to produce.  The ``defaults``
clause sets defaults for the digest options in the rest of the file.  Each
``digests`` clause specifies what to digest:

- The ``digest`` setting is the HTML digest file to write.

- The ``since`` setting indicates how far back to look for activity. It can use
  units of weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds, and can also be
  abbreviated, like ``1d6h``.

- The ``items`` setting is a list of things to report on, specified in a few
  different ways:

  - The ``url`` setting is a GitHub URL, in a number of forms:

    - An organization project URL will report on the issues and pull requests
      in the project. Your GitHub token will need the "read:project" scope.

    - A URL to a repo will report on the issues and pull requests in the repo.

    - A URL to a repo's issues will report on the issues in the repo.

    - A URL to a repo's pull requests will report on the pull requests in the
      repo.

    - Any of these URLs can point to a GitHub Enterprise installation instead
      of https://github.com.

  - The ``search`` setting can specify a GitHub search query to find issues or
    pull requests. The query will have an ``updated:`` term added to it to
    account for the ``since:`` setting.

  - If an item only needs to specify a GitHub URL, then it can simply be the
    URL string.

- The optional ``title`` setting will be used to construct the title
  and main header of the HTML page.

- For GitHub Enterprise, you can specify ``api_root``, which is the URL to
  build on for GraphQL API requests. It defaults to
  "https://api.github.com/graphql".

Items can have additional options:

- No activity is reported for bot users.  Some applications act as real users,
  but should be ignored anyway.  You can list those user names that should be
  ignored in the ``ignore_users`` setting.

- Items can have an explicit title set with the ``title:`` setting.

- Options for organization projects include:

  - ``home_repo`` is the owner/repo of the repo in which most issues will be
    created.  Issues in other repos will have the repo indicated in the
    digest.


Daily Publishing
================

The `sample digest <sample_>`_ is published daily using a GitHub Action from
its own repo: `nedbat/dinghy_sample <sample_repo_>`_.  You can use it as a
starting point for your own publishing.
